    DOM:

            1. Real Document Object Model:
                The DOM that is created by the browser is called the real DOM.
            2. Virtual Document Object Module:
                The DOM that is created by React is called the virtual DOM.
                The virtual DOM is faster than the real DOM.
                The virtual DOM is easier to work with than the real DOM.

    Rendering:
        The process of converting the virtual DOM into the real DOM is called rendering.
        There are two types of rendering:
        1. Server side rendering:

        2. Client side rendering:
            The process of converting the virtual DOM into the real DOM on the client is called client side rendering.
